A web based reference for the RPG Dark Heresy Trying to build this without a framework in order to learn as much as I can.  As of 12/11/21 using Tailwindcss and jQuery might 
consider using Alpine.js
Once I manage to get most of the project figured out I plan to rebuild it in React to completion

12/11/21 Updated Tailwindcss.  Resulted in hours of fun trying to get the thing to work properly again.  I think I might have the side navigation figured out using js to hide 
and reveal the appropriate links when the topic is clicked.  Now to see if I can get the proper pages to load with AJAX
